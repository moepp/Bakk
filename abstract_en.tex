\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{cha:abstract_en}

Over the course of my bachelor's thesis, an iPhone App has been developed as a
supplement to Benedikt Neuhold's Addition- and Subtraction Trainer.
The range of usage possibilities of the App consists basically of two functions:

As a primary function, an Online-Trainer has been developed, asking the base 
system for access. If the user's authentication was successful, arithmetical problems
are being submitted.
These arithmetical problems are presented in an appealing graphical manner, with 
the possibility for the user to enter the result.
For the purpose of the evaluation of the user's performance, the results and all
intermediate results such as carries are being logged. After every computation iteration
the results are being sent to the base system again, where they are being stored, 
together with the user's learning progress.

The secondary function of the App is an offline excercise, with the
possibility to train the user's skills anonymously and in different difficulty 
levels.
